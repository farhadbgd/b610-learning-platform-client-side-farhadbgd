            What is HTML?
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard set of tags used to create web pages. HTML code, while invisible to the user, is interpreted by your web browser and used to properly display the content of a page. When HTML is used in combination with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, programmers can create robust, interactive websites and applications. The international standards for HTML and CSS are maintained by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), a 400+ member organization with full-time staff dedicated to the development and maintenance of web standards and education. The W3C is also an edX member organization and provides online courses in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript as well as a professional certification in Front End Web Development.
